We recovered this binary from the notorious malware author Daax. The binary can't be ran so you'll need to handle this one with static analysis. Be warned though, your tools will not enjoy processing this file.

Shout out to Daax (https://revers.engineering/) for sharing several anti-RE techniques.

Note: This challenge requires a recent version of Windows 10 (1809+).

Hint: You can either figure out how to make this binary runnable and debug it or statically reverse it to find what input satisfies the program.
